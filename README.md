# Comprehensive News Search
A CMPT 359 Individual Project which is a comprehensive news search, using the News-API

## NOTE
Application data may not generate data as it uses the free plan of News-API. The app is limited
to 100 requests a day.

For testing, it is highly suggested that one would create their own api key from [News API](https://newsapi.org/), and
replace the `API_KEY` in the `NewsApi.kt` file.
